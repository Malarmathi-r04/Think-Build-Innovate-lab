# Activity 03 – Potentiometer

## 1. Objective

To understand analog input programming using Arduino by reading the variable voltage from a potentiometer and displaying the corresponding value.

## 2. Components Used

* Arduino UNO
* Potentiometer (10 kΩ)
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires

## 3. Circuit Diagram

The circuit was designed and simulated using Tinkercad.

## 4. Arduino Program

The Arduino program is available in the `code.ino` file.

## 5. Output

The potentiometer is rotated to vary the input voltage. The Arduino reads the analog voltage and produces a corresponding analog value ranging from **0 to 1023**.

## 6. Learning Outcome

* Understood analog input pins.
* Learned the use of `analogRead()`.
* Understood how a potentiometer works as a variable resistor.
* Learned how to read varying voltage using Arduino.
* Understood the difference between digital and analog input.

## 7. Challenges Faced

* Initially checked the potentiometer connections.
* Verified the connection between the potentiometer and Arduino analog pin.
* Checked the correct analog pin number used in the program.
* Verified the analog values while rotating the potentiometer.
* Corrected any syntax errors in the Arduino code.

## 8. Real-World Applications

* Volume control
* Brightness control
* Speed control
* Temperature adjustment
* User interface control systems

## 9. Connection to Your PoC

The potentiometer concept can be used to provide adjustable control or user input for parameters such as speed, brightness, sensitivity, or threshold values in my final Proof of Concept (PoC).
